         {"Aggregator is a collaborative project that competes in the NASA Lunabotics Competition. The project consists of the design, development,and construction of an autonomous mobile robot capable of completing objectives highlighted in the Lunabotics Competition rules of the year. Aggregator‚Äôs main objective is to connect bright engineers, both professional and novice, to facilitate a productive learning experience and conquer engineering problems.We accept anyone with drive and passion for engineering. Through Aggregator, one can expect to learn how to create robust mechanical design, use SolidWorks, manufacture, develop microcontrollers, code C++, and use ROS.\n\nWe typically meet Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Saturdays depending on the sub-team you wish to participate in (there are mechanical and electrical/software sub teams).\n\nTo get the most up-to-date information about meeting times and events check out our Calendar and join our discord for notifications. Our leadership changes annually, so it is best, and easiest, to contact us directly via discord, slack, or instagram. You can do so by asking questions in the questions channel or direct messaging anyone that is a Lead or an Executive Board member. Contact information can be found on our Contacts page."}

A Teensy microprocessor is used to handle all low-level processes such as processing data from/to motor drivers and linear actuators. All are controlled in C through the Arduino IDE for ease of access."
