REPOSITORY for Project 1

This project contains the source code for Team 50's porject, creating the website that will be used for the aggregator branch of the robotics club at the University of Florida.

The project members consited of:
    Jared Chen
    Zachary Claussen
    Vicente Cortes
    Steven Phang

The functionality of the website includes the following: Allowing for the viewing of different sections of the webpage, logging in, sending messages to the team, displaying the about section, contact us page, and images. Furthermore, the contact page includes links to the various social medias of the club members and the calendar allows for the viewing of club events.

To Run the project, the following commands should be used:

navigate to app folder

cd NewApp/testapp1

We used NPM as our installer, and in order to run the program you might need to install some dependencies into the system.

For example, if an error comes that you might not have bootstrap, the solution is to run 

npm install bootstrap --save in the NewApp/testapp1 directory.

if you get some errors regarding scripts, we found that running

npm install react-scripts --save

worked well to solve those issues

Finally to run the website, travel to:
cd NewApp/testapp1

and run:
npm start
